The WCH provided USB mass storage code uses a precompiled, not documented library (the Terrible Library). It must not be used. ST provides nice USB host examples for their microcontrollers, we will use that instead.

The ST provided USB mass storage code uses state machines for efficient, non blocking USB communication. Nice. But it requires the low level USB driver to also have such non-blocking functions. Sadly the WCH provided USB driver is Trash and provides only blocking functions (it does not even use interrupts).

The next step is to rewrite the low level driver based on the ST provided code and WCH datasheets.
